This is a template for the EDAV final project. It is based on the template created with *File   New Project... New Directory    Book Project using bookdown* in RStudio. 

## ABSOLUTE ESSENTIALS

### GitHub pages setup

- [ ] 1. On the home page of your repo, click Settings. Scroll down to the GitHub pages section and change **Source** to **master branch /docs folder**.  The URL of your book will be displayed in the green bar above **Source**. (Although the URL is displayed immediately, sometimes there is a delay until the book is actually published.)

- [ ] 2. Change the web site field on the top of home page of the repo to your book URL.

### File edits

- [ ] 1. Clone the repo.

- [ ] 2. In `index.Rmd`, change YOUR TITLE HERE to your title.

- [ ] 3. In `index.Rmd`, change YOUR NAMES HERE to your names.

- [ ] 4. In `_bookdown.yml`, change YOUR GITHUB USERNAME to your GitHub username.

- [ ] 5. In `_bookdown.yml`, change YOUR GITHUB REPO to your GitHub repo name.

- [ ] 6. In `_output.yml`, change YOUR SHORT TITLE to a shortened version of your title. (Leave the "after:" line as is.)

### Render the book

- [ ] 1. Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.

- [ ] 2. Commit and push the `docs` folder and any other changes to GitHub. 

(You will need to repeat this sequence every time you wish to update the book online.)
